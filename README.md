# dotfiles
Hey, 
These are my dotfiles. I use them to synchronize configurations between my machines 
(currently I primarly use a macOS machine). Feel free to use them, they should work
on all Unix platforms.
Run setup.sh to automatically install all relevant utilities and set up symbolic links
to your home directory (using GNU stow). Otherwise, any portion of this dotfiles is
of course used freely, and can also be used as reference for your own configuration.
The tools covered by this configuration are primarly Vim, Tmux, zsh.
Have fun :)
